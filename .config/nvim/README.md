# My Neovim configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration.

I am using [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as package manager, and
all the plugin entries with the plugin configurations are lua modules in the
lua/plugins directory. Look in that directory to see the plugins I am using.

To install in a linux system just clone the repo in $HOME/.config/nvim. I
prepared the config for neovim 0.9, some features may not work with previous
versions.
