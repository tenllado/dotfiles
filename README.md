# Dotfiles

This is the repository for my configuration files. I decided to go back to
simple symlinks, to keep it simple.

## Deploying the configuration

1. Clone the repository in your home directory
2. Create symbolic links for the files in the repository on your home directory.

I added a install script that creates all the links requered.
